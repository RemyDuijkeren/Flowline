**Flowline** is a lightweight CLI tool that streamlines the deployment of Power Platform solutions while tracking all
changes in git.

It follows a GitHubFlow-style process to clone, sync, and deploy solutions, offering a flexible alternative to
Microsoft's rigid Power Platform Pipelines. Unlike Microsoft's approach of moving managed solutions across controlled
environments, Flowline gives you the freedom to deploy unmanaged solutions where and how you want — keeping you in
control while maintaining a complete source history in your git repository.

## 🚀 Why Flowline?

Power Platform Pipelines only support deploying managed solutions.
Flowline exists to give you a flexible, developer-friendly alternative:

- ✅ Works with **unmanaged solutions**
- ✅ Fits naturally into **GitHubFlow and source control workflows**
- ✅ Simple commands to **clone, sync, and deploy**
- ✅ No locked-down layers, no forced managed-only structures

Flowline is inspired by real flowlines: focused, adaptable, and purpose-built to get your solution from *source* to
*target* — without the unnecessary infrastructure.

Flowline keeps it simple:

- You own your environments.
- You control your source.
- You choose unmanaged.
